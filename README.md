# Convolutional-Net-Prototype-Ensemble
implementation of ICDE 2019 paper: Robust High Dimensional Stream Classification with Novel Class Detection (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335174760_robust_high_dimensional_stream_classification_with_novel_class_detection)

## Requirments
All training and test are done in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework.

Pytorch vesion: 0.4.0

Python version: 3.7

## Illustration
